# My-Portfolio
This is my Portfolio Website . This Website is fully Responsive for all the devices . 
In this Website I used Following technologies HTML, CSS and add some functionalty using Javascript. 
You can also download My resume from this website. The Form Section Which I made in this website is also working . 
When we submit details in form then those details will sent to google sheet and saved there. 
I also put some creative hover effact, when we hover on cards, Images and Buttons. Hovering Effact was Looking Nice

I made a good navabar in which i put 5 Button , HOME, ABOUT, Services, Portfolio and Contact 
When we hover on buttons you see beatifull line effact and click on that buttton you will go that particular section
 ** Like If we click on contact then you will go on contact section 
 You can fill your details these deatils will save on google sheet
